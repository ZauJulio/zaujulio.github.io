### Hello Padawans <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/nDg8O2z3Rmk6Y/source.gif" width="30px">

I'm at university, always researching and learning something new, very well accompanied by my playlists.

I am currently learning about machine learning and artificial intelligence, but I am also interested in cloud and web. I'll tell you right away, I love Python and Linux. Death to Java.

- 📧 Talk to me by email, remember to bring a cup of coffee...
- 🐦 Follow me there on Twitter, nothing to do with GitHub :D
