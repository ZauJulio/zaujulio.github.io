# Carne de Sol com Macaxeira

A staple of northeastern Brazilian cuisine. Sun-dried beef paired with creamy cassava and topped with melted coalho cheese and butter.

## Ingredients

- 500g carne de sol (sun-dried beef), desalted
- 500g macaxeira (cassava), peeled and cut into pieces
- 200g queijo coalho (coalho cheese), sliced
- 3 tbsp butter
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt to taste
- Fresh parsley for garnish

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the cassava**: Boil the macaxeira in salted water for about 25-30 minutes, until tender. Drain and set aside.
2. **Prepare the beef**: Cut the carne de sol into medium chunks. In a hot skillet, sear the meat on all sides until golden brown. Set aside.
3. **Sauté**: In the same skillet, add butter and garlic. Sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
4. **Combine**: Add the boiled macaxeira to the skillet, tossing with the garlic butter. Add the seared carne de sol on top.
5. **Add cheese**: Place coalho cheese slices on top. Cover and let the cheese melt for 2-3 minutes.
6. **Serve**: Garnish with fresh parsley and serve immediately.

## Tips

> The key to great carne de sol is proper desalting. Soak the meat in water for at least 12 hours, changing the water 2-3 times.

- You can substitute macaxeira with regular potatoes if cassava is unavailable
- Queijo coalho can be replaced with halloumi for a similar texture
